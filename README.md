# `self.improve()`

Self-improvement with bad puns and even worse code.

## About

This repo contains notes relating to my professional development. It includes(some of) my career goals, and I’ll be taking notes on the books I read and conferences I attend to achieve them.

## Why a repo?

Why not? I thought it would be funny to open issues and pull requests to improve myself. Making it public with an auditable history keeps me accountable. As a side benefit, it also helps make my contribution graph look like I’m productive.

## Contents
